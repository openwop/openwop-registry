/**
 * Pack-internal schema `$id` must name the pack's CURRENT version.
 *
 * CONTRIBUTING.md § "Pack-internal JSON Schemas" makes this normative: the `$id`
 * MUST be `https://packs.openwop.dev/<pack>/<version>/<file>`, the version
 * segment MUST match `pack.json.version`, and *"Pack `version` bump: regenerate
 * every `$id` in the pack's `schemas/` directory to the new version."*
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT A HEREDOC. This check previously existed ONLY as an
 * inline `node -e` block inside `.github/workflows/packs-check.yml`. That meant
 * it could not be run locally, could not be unit-tested, could not be
 * sabotage-probed, and was absent from `scripts/registry-check.sh` — the repo's
 * own `npm run check`. So a routine version bump turned `main` red and stayed
 * red for four days, because the only way to observe the gate was to push.
 *
 * CONTRIBUTING.md also claimed `scripts/precheck-packs.mjs` "SHOULD catch drift".
 * It does not check `$id` at all. An unrunnable gate plus a false claim about a
 * different gate is how this became invisible.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/check-pack-schema-ids.mjs [--fix]
 *   (no flag) report drift and exit 1
 *   --fix     rewrite each drifted `$id` in place, then report
